# Philadelphia Snow Emergency Routes

(Eventually) a map of Philadelphia's snow emergency routes.

From the [Streets Department snow emergency route page](http://www.philadelphiastreets.com/highways/snow/emergency-routes/) 

> When snow accumulations approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency. Once emergency status is declared, the City's 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW for its location. Do NOT call 911.

TODO: The current data was generated by filtering the
[street centerline layer](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-open-geodata/tree/master/street_centerline)
by street name. This first pass needs to be cleaned up to match the
routes defined in [phl-snow-emergency-routes.csv](https://github.com/jwalgran/phl-snow-emergency-routes/blob/master/phl-snow-emergency-routes.csv)
